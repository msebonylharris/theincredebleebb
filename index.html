				<p> The Incredible Ebb AKA Ebony Harris has been making/selling jewelry for a long
				time. I don't mean to brag, but "her jewelry is out of this world." Check it out and you 
				will be disappointed. So, Are you still reading? Great, cause I have more below. 
				Just in case you did not notice, I have added an additional paragraph, becuase it is 
				required by my class to turn three paragraphs into a three column design to describe
				this site. So, where should I start. I can't say that I am good with words, but let me
				try.Well here it it, the first page is the index.html which is the one you are on now. It
				is where the main content is. The next page is summercollection.html and that is where
				you will find my photos. And the last page is the contact page. It just gives fake contact
				info. Well that's my site.</p>
			
				<p> I am basically coping the information that I formally entered in over again. Attempting
				to update my site and create this column that I mentioned in the previous paragraph. That
				means you will be reading some duplicate content.So, Are you still reading? Great, cause I have more below.
